angular-seed

index.html  is the  entry point (like app.xaml)

<script src="app.js"></script>    <-- this is the entry point for angular

localhost:8080/#/       <-- # is an anchor

most angular apps are single page websites

ng-app="myAppName"  <--- adding  this in html means 'start using angular from this point.'

$scope      <---  Don't use it - it's the old way of doing things. (Add things to global scope.)
                  instead use     var that = this;

ng-cloak    <--- Use it (need a script as well - check google for script) to hide your app
                 until angular has loaded. (Otherwise your page will render incorrectly)
ng-show/hide <-- Aside from obvious, can be used in tandom with controller.data to show/hide
                 the form and a 'loading' adorner.
